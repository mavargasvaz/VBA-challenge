This code help to you to navigate through one year of stock data and reads/ stores all of the following values from each row:

Ticker symbol 
Total stock volume 
Yearly change ($) 
Percent change 

I have applied conditional format to the Yearly change in order to identified negative values and positive values

You can see at your right a Summary that will provide useful information like:
Greatest % Increase (5 points)
Greatest % Decrease (5 points)
Greatest Total Volume (5 points)

The VBA script can run on all sheets successfully.
